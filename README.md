This project showcases a Movie Recommendation System built using two fundamental techniques:

Demographic Filtering

Collaborative Filtering (User-Based)

1. Demographic Filtering
Demographic Filtering recommends movies based on their overall popularity and critical reception. It is a non-personalized approach that ranks movies using factors such as:

Average rating

Number of votes

Weighted score (e.g., IMDB’s weighted rating formula)

✅ Pros:
Simple and fast

Effective for new users (cold start problem)

Works well for highlighting popular or trending movies

❌ Limitations:
Same recommendations for every user

Doesn’t consider individual preferences

📌 2. Collaborative Filtering
To overcome the limitations of demographic filtering, we implemented Collaborative Filtering, which offers personalized recommendations. Specifically, we used:

👥 User-Based Collaborative Filtering
Recommends movies by identifying users with similar rating behavior

Measures similarity using metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation

Predicts movies a user might like based on the preferences of similar users

✅ Pros:
Personalized recommendations

Suggests diverse genres

Improves with more user interaction

❌ Limitations:
Struggles with new users (cold start)

Can be computationally expensive on large datasets

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (for similarity computations)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations



📁 Notebook Structure
